# Belwin Citizen Science 
The Belwin Citizen Science App is a full-stack mobile-view web application for students to record their nature observations during trips to the Belwin Conservancy. It provides an interactive tool for students to track their observations for each site, record any notes, and for staff to be able to consolidate and view current student data. Students can use the application offline for data collection in the field, when the device is connected back to the internet, students will be able to submit data collected.
